# FixChat

Simple, lightweight Bukkit plugin that makes chatting with your friends in game, and on dynmap much easier.

## Features

* Adds **aliases for the tell command** so players can use /tell, /t, /whisper, and /w to send private messages to others.
* Adds **reply functionality** so players can easily reply using the added /reply and /r commands.
* Adds **Dynmap integration** to show achievement unlocks, player deaths, /me messages, and /say messages.

## Commands

This plugin adds aliases for the tell command so you can use any of the following to send a whisper:

* `/tell <player> <message>`
* `/t <player> <message>`
* `/whisper <player> <message>`
* `/w <player> <message>`

You can also easily reply to the last player you received a whisper from by using the reply command:

* `/reply <message>`
* `/r <message>`

## Configuration

At this point there is no configuration needed - just drop it into your plugins directory.
